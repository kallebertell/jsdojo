Basics

- var person = new Object() === var person = {}
- function Foo() {}; Foo.__proto__ === Foo.prototype //=> false


Facts

* The prototype object is meant to be used on constructor functions, basically functions that will be called using the new operator to create new object instances
* Every object in Javascript has a prototype
* As confusing as it may sound, this "prototype" property is not the real prototype (__proto__) of the function.
